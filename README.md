#Here are my dotfiles

I put this repo together following [Michael Smalley's method](http://blog.smalleycreative.com/tutorials/using-git-and-github-to-manage-your-dotfiles/)

To install these, run:
    git clone https://github.com/judsonmitchell/dotfiles.git
    cd ~/dotfiles
    chmod +x makesymlinks.sh
    ./makesymlinks.sh

My vim is configured with:

* Pathogen
* Ctrl-P
* Vim-Fugitive
* Syntastic
* Gsession.vim 
* Various syntax highlighters for php, js, etc
